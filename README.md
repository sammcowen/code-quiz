# code-quiz

## WHY
This code quiz was a perfect project to implement my knowledge of JavaScript and use the web API localStorage().
Practice makes perfect , and creating your own code instead of using starter code, forces you to use your knowledge and get creative.

## WHAT I DID 
I created a web responsive quiz that tests users on JavaScript basics.The user is presented with a set of instructions and a start button. 
The quiz is timed and counts down from 60 ,every second. Upon clicking the start button ,the user is presented with a question and multiple choices as answers.
The choices change color when hovered over, to ensure the user is aware of what they select for their answer. If the question is right, a message displays correct 
and the user gets a new question. If wrong, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer and the user gets an alert that the answer was wrong.The game ends when the user  
answers all of the questions or when the timer hits 0. Thus presenting the user with their score, and a text area to input their initials or name and store their score.
They can view the top scores and they may play again if they choose by pushing the play again button, which reloads the page.

## WHAT I LEARNED
 I see an improvement in my structure ofJavascript code and my ability to create functions that work how as I wish them to. I learned the importance of labeling things clearly
not only for me , but for other reading my code.When you label your html elements clearly and put them in order, it makes creating event handlers so much easier. 
Console.log is also very important when using the localStore API as you can see what you are doing, and if it is returning what you want it to.
